### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am just starting to learn how to use html and CSS, because I was bored. Essentially, I'm just doing a bit of trial and error, seeing what works or not.
I'm sure this will evolve eventually, but so far I am enjoying myself.

Not particularly looking for help or advice at this point, but that may change as time goes on.
